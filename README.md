- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ryan! (@Ryan0C)
- ðŸ‘‰ I work in the IT industry where I spend a large amount of my professional time with Linux, the cloud, and infrastructure automation.
- ðŸ‘‰ I am always trying to learn new things, and enjoy tinkering around with all sorts of tech/programming.
- ðŸ‘‰ I spend some of my free time working on related Linux, Python, PHP, VueJS, TypeScript, Automation, and Open Source projects.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small Linux projects, VueJS, PHP, TypeScript, or Python-related projects when I'm not busy putting out fires at work.
